What I have learned from this course

During this Git and GitHub module I learned how to initialize repositories, stage and commit changes, craft clear commit messages, create and switch branches, fork and clone repositories for collaboration, open and review pull requests, and synchronize local and remote histories. I also practiced safely rewriting history and understood when force pushing is appropriate.
